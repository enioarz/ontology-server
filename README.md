# Ontology Server prototype

This is a WIP to build an ontology static site generator and server. Intended as a drop-in replacement for [LODE](https://github.com/essepuntato/LODE) with some intended new capabilities.

## Naming

I am still thinking about a name, this started as a vizualization project that I wanted to call barred-owl, because it uses [horned-owl](https://github.com/phillord/horned-owl) but it turned out becoming something different. The current working name I'm using is hyper-ontology, because in the end I want to use it to build semantically enriched [hypermedia-driven applications](https://htmx.org/essays/hypermedia-driven-applications/). I am open to suggestions for a proper name.
